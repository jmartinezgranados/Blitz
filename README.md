# Blitz
## What is it?
This extension puts all pull requests across all repositories into a queue. This allows users to review open pull requests and click the link to go to work the pull request.

## Details
This is for VSTS (TFS). This extension shows all of the open pull requests in a project. The approver can then follow a link to work the pull request.

## Widget
Comes with a widget that will show all active pull requests in your project across all repositories. Here's how it looks:

## Update 0.9.9
Added ability to filter to only pull requests created by user.

## Update 0.9.6
Made each row clickable, taking you to the pull request.

## Source Code and Issue Reporting
I've added the source to [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/sierpinski/Blitz). Please open issues with the extension there so I can track them more easily.

## Why did I make it?
Our state's mail server went down and pull requests fell through the cracks. We also had some pull requests which dropped off the radar before they were completed. I just wanted a solution to see all of the pull requests across hundreds of repo.'s. So, I made one!

## Feature Ideas
Dive into code policies and more detailed statuses for each pull request.
